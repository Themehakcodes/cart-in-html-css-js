This is a simple e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a shopping cart that allows users to add and remove items, as well as a checkout process that calculates the total cost of the items.

Demo
Check out the live demo of the website here.

YouTube Channel
I also have a YouTube channel where I post tutorials on web development and programming. You can check it out here.
